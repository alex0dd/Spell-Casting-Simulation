1)player starts cast: CastStartEvent triggered (need to update status, like casting = True)
2)player can't do anything when casting
3)once cast is finished: CastEndEvent triggered (need to update status, casting=False and apply damage if applicable)
4)if failed to cast, then trigger CastEndEvent and do same update as in 3)

when a spell is casted, we dispatch a cast end event in a certain delta time, so it'll be triggered again after some time steps
